# Bugs

Not tracking new Bank transactions. Default Cash and Savings Transactions working fine. (Due Firebase not querying Documents and only querying Collections > Documents, all calculations are handled with JavaScript, no query used.)

UI - Had a problem styling Radio Buttons (when applying display:flex on container divs the browser was overridding the display:flex to inline block which was messing up the whole UI)

## Select a Category when adding transaction (Cash/Savings)
