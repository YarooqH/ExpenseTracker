# Bugs

- Not tracking new Bank transactions. Default Cash and Savings Transactions working fine. (Could not figure out Firebase Document queries, all calculations are handled with JavaScript, no queries used.)

- UI - Had a problem styling Radio Buttons (when applying display:flex on container divs the browser was overridding the display:flex to inline block (probably because of bad html) which was messing up the whole UI)

- Select a Category when adding transaction (Cash/Savings)
